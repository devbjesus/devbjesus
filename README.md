### What I do

I build fast, reliable web experiences and automate business workflows so marketing, operations, and commerce teams don’t need engineering for every change. I also help grow technical teams through hands-on mentoring.

### About My solutions

- High-performance storefronts and landing pages (Fast, stable, and accessible interfaces with clean navigation and content that marketing can easily update)

- Business websites ready to launch (Company sites and service pages published, configured, and prepared to capture contact and new opportunities)

- Commerce platforms that convert (Headless e-commerce setups with reliable checkout, payment integration, and logistics flows working end to end)

- Backend and integrations (Secure APIs, async processes, and data flows that keep critical parts of the business running predictably)

- Automated operations (Internal routines for support, lead qualification, marketing, and reporting that run automatically)

- Reliability and visibility (Monitoring, alerts, and clear health indicators so the team can spot issues early and fix them before users feel the impact)
